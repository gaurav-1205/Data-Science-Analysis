# Data-Science-Analysis
These are the assignments of Data-Science-analysis coures offered by the Department of Astrophysics, IIT Hyderabad

### 1. Gaussianizing using BoxCox transformation
Download the eccentricity distribution of exoplanets from the exoplanet catalog http://exoplanet.eu/catalog/. Look for the column titled e,which denotes the eccentricity. Draw the histogram of this distribution. Then redraw the same histogram after Gaussianizing the distribution using Box-transformation either using scipy.stats.boxcox or from first principles using the equations in arXiv:1508.00931.

### 2. CLT for Chi-Square-Distribution
Produce a plot for a sample drawn the from chi-square distribution with degrees of freedom equal to 3, for samples drawn once, 5 times, and 10 times and verify the Central Limit Theorem.
Ref : AstroML book fig 3.20


### 3. Histograms of bootstrap samples
Draw a similar histogram of median of 10,000 bootstrap samples drawn from the same Gaussian distribution. Refer to http://tinyurl.com/h6p43o8 for the details. Overlay a Gaussian distribution on top of the histogram with mean equal to the mean
of the generated data sample and standard deviation equal to the standard
deviation of the median. 


### 4. Chi-square curve fitting
Use Chi-square minimization to obtain best fit values for b and m for exercise 1 on page 5 in arxiv:1008.4686
